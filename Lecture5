Scheduling
-----------------
It is crucial concept in automation, especially for DevOps Engineer
It allows scripts to run at predefined times without any manual intervention

Types of scheduling in Linux
------------------------------------
1. One-time execution - "at" command
2. Recurring execution - cron jobs

One-time execution
-------------------------------
"at" command

sudo apt install at ---- Debian based (Ubuntu)
sudo yum install at --- RHEL based (Amazon Linux, CentOS)


Recurring execution
---------------------------------
The cron daemon is used to execute scheduled tasks at fixed intervals
CRON is an utility in Linux OS to schedule jobs execution

	- Delete tmp files
	- Take the backup files
	- System health checks

cron expression/format
* * * * * -----> every minute the job will get executed

First * ----> Minute (0-59)
Second * -----> Hour (0-23)
Third * ----> Day of a month (1-31)
Fourth * ----> Month (1-12)
Fifth * ----> Day of a week (0-7)

Where to configure the cronjob in Linux?
-------------------------------------------------
"crontab file" is used to configure cronjobs in Linux OS.
It will be available for every Linux VM

sudo yum install cronie -y

sudo systemctl start crond
sudo systemctl enable crond

sudo systemctl status crond


Practice - Cron Jobs Examples
-------------------------------------------
Below are some cron job examples that show how to schedule a task to run on different time periods.

Run a command at 15:00 on every day from Monday through Friday:
0 15 * * 1-5 command
Ex: 0 15 * * 1-5 pwd

Run a script every 5 minutes and redirected the standard output to dev null, only the standard error will be sent to the specified e-mail address:
MAILTO=email@example.com
*/5 * * * * /path/to/script.sh > /dev/null

Run two commands every Monday at 3 PM (use the operator && between the commands):
0 15 * * Mon command1 && command2
Ex: 0 15 * * Mon pwd && whoami

Run a PHP script every 2 minutes and write the output to a file :
*/2 * * * * /usr/bin/php /path/to/script.php >> /var/log/script.log

Run a script every day, every hour, on the hour, from 8 AM through 4 PM:
00 08-16 * * * /path/to/script.sh

Run a script on the first Monday of each month, at 7 a.m.
0 7 1-7 * 1 /path/to/script.sh

Run the a script at 9:15pm, on the 1st and 15th of every month:
15 9 1,15 * * /path/to/script.sh

Set custom HOME, PATH, SHELL and MAILTO variables and run a command every minute.
HOME=/opt
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
SHELL=/usr/bin/zsh
MAILTO=email@example.com
