if you want to print a message for multiple times, we will use 'Loop' concept

What is a loop?
Loops are used to execute the same statement multiple times
Used to repeat a set of commands until a condition is satisfied

Types of Loops;
1. Range based loop - if you already know how many times you want to execute a statement then we will use 'Range based loop'
						Ex: for
2. Conditional based loop - if you dont know the range and you want to execute a statement until the condition the is true then we will use 'Conditional based loop'
						Ex: while

FOR Loop

	do
		<Statements>
done

WHILE Loop
---------------------------
while loop is used to execute until the condition is true

Syntax

while [ condition ]
do
	<Statements>
done
